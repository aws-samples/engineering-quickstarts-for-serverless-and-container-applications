## Engineering quickstarts for serverless and container applications

This repo holds scaffolding and project starter files to quickly launch a cloud-native project on AWS.

Each project scaffolding provides several examples for common use cases.
As an example, if DynamoDB is used, examples would include endpoints to read and write to a table using filters and conditional expressions.
