# IDT Provisioning Instructions

This document provides a step by step procedure for IDT instrcutors to follow in provisioning an AWS Integrated DevOps Toolchain (IDT) environment to facilitate training, workshops, iead labs etc...

## Package 0: Provisioning  + Prerequisties

These instructions are drafts and will be broken out into sections using labels used by the AWS and CircelCI teams. We will use the Generic term `Package:` followed by a number to designate which segment of the project we're addressing. The Package: term is for internal use at the moment.

**Package 0:** Defines the core segment. Subsequent packages will be built upon Package 0.

## GitHub Organization

A GitHub Organization must be created. The following will guid you through creating a GitHub organization.

**Step 1: Login to GitHub**
- Login to your GitHub account. Go to GitHub's official website "[github.com](https://github.com)" and enter your login credentials.

**Step 2: Go to the New Organization Creation Page**
- After logging in, click on your profile picture (avatar) on the top right side of your dashboard screen. A dropdown menu will appear.
- Click on "Your organizations" in the dropdown menu. It will forward you to another page.
- On this page, click on the green button "New organization" on the right side.

**Step 3: Choose Your Plan**
- You will be asked to choose your plan. You can choose either Free or Team.
- Choose as per your requirement. If you're creating just for practice then go with the 'Free' plan. Click the 'Next' button after selecting the plan.

**Step 4: Fill out Organization Details**
- You will be taken to a 'Create a new organization' page.
- Fill in the Organization account name which should be unique.
- Provide an email (The email will help GitHub to send updates related to organization).
- Choose your Team/Project name. 
- Click on 'Create Organization'.

**Step 5: Invite Members**
- After creating the organization, you can optionally enter the usernames or email addresses of other GitHub users you want to add to your new organization.
- You can also define a role for new members whether they are owners or just members.
- Then, click the "Invite" button to send them an invitation. 

**Step 6: Setup Teams (Optional)**
- You can also set up different teams for your organization. It helps you manage access control by grouping users permissions into teams.

**Step 7: Verify your Email**
- Finally, you'll receive a verification link in your email that you've provided for the organization.
- Go to your email and click on the verification link to verify your account. 

Your organization is now created and active on GitHub! You can start creating repositories and start working on your projects. Remember, any repositories, issues, and notes created under this organization will belong to it as per GitHub rules.

## Fork the AWS IDT Example repo into a GitHub Organization

Sure, here is a step-by-step guide on how to fork the provided repository into a GitHub organization:

**Step 1: Go to the Repository Link**
- Open the link to the repository you wish to fork: [https://github.com/aws-samples/engineering-quickstarts-for-serverless-and-container-applications](https://github.com/aws-samples/engineering-quickstarts-for-serverless-and-container-applications)

**Step 2: Start the Forking Process**
- Click on the 'Fork' button. This is located in the top right part of the webpage, right next to the 'Star' and 'Watch' buttons.

**Step 3: Choose the Destination**
- Once you click on 'Fork', a popup appears asking you where you want to fork the repository. This is where you should choose the organization where you want the fork to go to.

**Step 4: Fork Initialization**
- After selecting the organization, GitHub starts the forking process, creating a new repository in the selected organization. This process may take several seconds, depending on the size of the repository.

**Step 5: Workflow Verification**
- When the process finishes, you'll be redirected to the forked repository in your GitHub organization.

Remember, you need to be an owner or have sufficient permissions in the organization to create new repositories, in order to be able to fork repositories into a GitHub organization. If the chosen place is an organization and you don't have the required permissions, you'll need to contact the organization administrators.

## CircleCI - Provision and setup project

**Step 1: Create a CircleCI Account**

Create a CircleCI account by doing the following:

- Visit [https://circleci.com/](https://circleci.com/)

## Pacakage: 1 - Extensible Segments

In this package you'll provision accounts and access for the various services and tools your pipelines will integrate with.

## CircleCI Context environment variable provisioning

This section demostrates how to create CircleCI Context Environment Variables programaticaly using a special purpose built python script. You must provide the script the data it will use to create the context variables for your project. These values are defined and stored in the `credentials.toml` file.

## Capture credentials from the services and tools you will use in your pipeline.

For this section we will demonstrate how to generate a new `credentials.toml` file and populate it with the values for the respective integrations. In this examnple we'll use, Snyk, Git Guardian and AWS services which will require you to create a new account and generate new API Tokens for the respective integration.

## Git Guardian

Follow the step-by-step instructions below to create a new account and generate API Tokens on GitGuardian:

### Creating a new account

**Step 1:** Head to GitGuardian's homepage

Access GitGuardian's website by entering the following URL into your browser: `https://www.gitguardian.com/`.

**Step 2:** Click on `Get Started`

You can find this button on the upper right side of the screen. 

**Step 3:** Create a New Account

In the login screen, click on the `Sign up` link.

**Step 4:** Provide Required Information

You will need to enter the following information to create your account:
- Your first and last name

You will be prompted to name the new API token. Using a descriptive name can be beneficial to remember what specific project or purpose the token was created for.

**Step 4:** Token Configuration

Choose the permissions and scope for this token based on your needs. Be cautious while doing this since the token authorization can provide access to your GitGuardian account.

**Step 5:** Generate the Token

After setting the configurations, click on the `Generate token` button. 

**Step 6:** Copy your new API Token

Once the token is generated, it will be displayed to you. Be sure to copy the auth token string to `credentials.toml` - `snyk_token` 

**Note:** Treat your API tokens as you would your password - don't share them with untrusted third parties, don't transmit them insecurely, and donâ€™t commit them in your codebase.

## Snyk

We will use Snyk to run an automated security scan of our application an its dependencies. 

- Create an account with Snyk - https://app.snyk.io/
- Skip the integration step by clicking "Choose other integration" at the bottom of the options list.
- Click on your avatar in the bottom of the sidebar to show a dropdown
- Choose "Account Settings"
- Click to show your Auth Token
- Copy the auth token string to `credentials.toml` - `snyk_token` 

### CircleCI

Create a CircleCI Personal API token:

**Step 1**
Visit the CircleCI official website and log in to your account. You will need an existing account on CircleCi to proceed. 

**Step 2**
After logging in, navigate to the main dashboard, where you will see an overview of your projects. 

**Step 3**
In the left-hand navigation sidebar, click on "User".

**Step 4**
In the opened drop-down list, select "Personal API Tokens".

**Step 5**
On the Personal API Tokens page, click on the "Create New Token" button. 

**Step 6**
A dialog box will appear. You will need to input the name of your new token. It helps to give it a name that represents its purpose. After typing the token name, click on the "Add API Token" button.

**Step 7**
Your new token will be generated and shown to you. Please remember to copy it and keep it safe since it will not be shown again for security reasons. 

**Step 8**
Once you have copied your token, click on the "I have copied my token" button.

You have now successfully created your CircleCI Personal API Token! Use it carefully and remember, it's personal, so it's crucial to keep it secured and not share it with anyone else. Always remember to regenerate a new token if you suspect a security threat.

### Configure credemtials in the credentials.toml file

Copy over the credentials source file. This is untracked in Git and will be used by a script to populate your CircleCI secret variables.

```
cd python/powertools-sls/.circleci/scripts

cp .circleci/scripts/sample_credentials.toml credentials.toml
```

In the credentials.toml file, populate the values of the respective keys with the credentials you captured in previous steps. These values will be retirived by the provisioning.py script and create the context variables in the CircleCI platform.


Install Python depedencies:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Provision Context environment variables

In this step you will excute the `provsioning.py` script to create the environment variables used in your project

```
python3 provisioning.py
```

Upon completion the contexts variables and their values will be created for yourt project.
